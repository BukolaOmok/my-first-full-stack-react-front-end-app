This is my first full stack app. I have connected this react front end (hosted on NETLIFY) to the server using an API hosted on RENDER.com

I used BEEKEEPER as my database to host my data and POSTMAN to see that my get and post request are working in realtime.

## Future development
- try deleting some data
- changing some data
